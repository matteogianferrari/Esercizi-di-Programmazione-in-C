# Esercizi-di-Programmazione-in-C
My code solutions for the book "Esercizi di Programmazione in Linguaggio C" written by "Costantino Grana" and "Marco Manfredi".

I did the exercises proposed by the book to test my knowledge in C programming language.

These solutions can be a useful resource for students of the "Ingegneria Informatica" degree who are attending the course of "Fondamenti di Informatica I e lab." (INF-1) at Unimore.

Personally I think this book is very useful because it allows you to practice in different topics.
